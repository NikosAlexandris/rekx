# Well known tools

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)
and HDF (Hierarchical Data Format)
are widely used formats for storing and handling large scientific data sets.
There are several tools available for working with these formats,
each offering different functionalities.
from basic file manipulation to sophisticated data analysis and visualization.

A list of some well-known tools :
